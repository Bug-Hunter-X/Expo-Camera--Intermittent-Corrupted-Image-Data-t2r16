# Expo Camera: Intermittent Corrupted Image Data

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera component where, under certain conditions, the returned image data is corrupted. This leads to blank or distorted images being displayed in the application.

## Bug Description

The issue appears to be intermittent. It is more likely to occur when capturing larger images or rapidly switching between camera modes. The corrupted image data is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Take several photos, experimenting with different resolutions and rapidly switching between photo and video modes.
5. Observe that some of the captured images may be blank or distorted.

## Solution

The provided `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a potential solution.  While it doesn't fix the root cause of the problem in the Expo Camera, it incorporates error handling and data validation to mitigate the effects of the corrupted image data. This approach involves checking for null or undefined values before processing and using a fallback mechanism to provide a default image or error message.

This is a workaround, and ideally, a proper fix would come from improvements within the Expo Camera component itself. However, this solution provides a more robust way of handling the unpredictable behavior currently experienced.
