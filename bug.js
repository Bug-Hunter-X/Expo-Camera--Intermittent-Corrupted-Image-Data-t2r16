This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component with specific image formats.  The issue is that the image data returned by the camera might be corrupted or incomplete, leading to errors when processing or displaying the image. This typically manifests as blank images, distorted images, or crashes within the application. The problem is exacerbated when dealing with larger image sizes or when switching between different camera modes rapidly.  The inconsistency in image data makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause consistently.
